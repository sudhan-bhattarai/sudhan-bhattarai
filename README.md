I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering with a focus on **stochastic optimization**, **operations research**, and **data-driven decision-making**. My GitHub showcases a collection of research projects, algorithms, and applications in **supply chain logistics**, **time series modeling**, and optimization under uncertainty. I enjoy transforming complex real-world problems into mathematical models and solving them using `Python`, `Gurobi`, and `machine learning` techniques. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect if you'd like to collaborate or discuss ideas!

* 🌍  I'm based at *Clemson, SC, United States*
* ✉️  You can contact me at [sudhan.bhattarai26@gmail.com](mailto:sudhan.bhattarai26@gmail.com)
* 🧠  I'm learning machine learning models such as Transformer architectures to enhance time-series forecasting within optimization frameworks.
* ⚡  Outside of work, I enjoy watching football (soccer) matches, occasionally playing, socializing with friends, and traveling to new places.
* 📄 I have shared some of my **research publications** [here](research.md)
* 📝 My **resume** is located [here](resume.pdf)
