## Multistage stochastic programming for integrated networkoptimization in hurricane relief logistics and evacuation planning

**Authors:** Sudhan Bhattarai, Yongjia Song

**Journal:** *Networks*, Volume 85, 3-37, 2025

**DOI:** [10.1002/net.22249](https://doi.org/10.1002/net.22249)

**Abstract:**  
In this article, we study the integrated hurricane relief logistics and evacuation planning (IHRLEP) problem, integrating hurricane evacuation and relief item pre-positioning operations that are typically treated separately. We propose a fully adaptive multistage stochastic programming (MSSP) model and solution approaches based on two-stage stochastic programming (2SSP). Utilizing historical forecast errors modeled using the auto-regressive model of order one, we generate hurricane scenarios and approximate the hurricane process as a Markov chain, and each Markovian state is characterized by the hurricane's location and intensity attributes. We conduct a comprehensive numerical experiment based on case studies motivated by Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Ian. Through the computational results, we demonstrate the value of fully adaptive policies given by the MSSP model over static ones given by the 2SSP model in terms of the out-of-sample performance. By conducting an extensive sensitivity analysis, we offer insights into how the value of fully adaptive policies varies in comparison to static ones with key problem parameters.

## Integrated Hurricane Relief Logistics and Evacuation Planning under Forecast Uncertainty: A Case Study for Hurricane Florence

**Abstract:**  
In this paper, we study an integrated hurricane relief logistics and evacuation planning (HRLEP) problem. We propose stochastic optimization models and methods that integrate the hurricane relief item pre-positioning problem and the hurricane evacuation planning problem, which are often treated as separate problems in the literature, by incorporating the forecast information as well as the forecast errors (FE). Specifically, we fit historical FE data into an auto-regressive model of order one (AR-1), from which we generate FE realizations to create evacuation demand scenarios. We compare a static decision policy based on the proposed stochastic optimization model with a dynamic policy obtained by applying this model in a rolling-horizon (RH) procedure. We conduct a preliminary numerical experiment based on real-world data to validate the value of stochastic optimization and the value of the dynamic policy based on the RH procedure.

## A multi-objective home healthcare routing problem

**Authors:** Sudhan Bhattarai, Yaneth Correa-Martinez, Leonardo Bedoya-Valencia

**Journal:** International Journal of Healthcare Management, Volume 16, Issue 2, 311-325, 2023  

**DOI:** [10.1080/20479700.2022.2102111](https://doi.org/10.1080/20479700.2022.2102111)

**Abstract:**  
As demand for home health care (HHC) services surges due to an aging population and public health constraints, HHC companies need to optimize their activities. Increasing costs to deliver care and the need to optimize the capacity of acute care settings such as hospitals, make the planning of HHC services more challenging. To optimally deliver care, the caregivers’ activities must be planned considering conflicting objectives. The proposed multi-objective HHC problem considers three components in the planning process: patients, nurses, and providers. An exact method is presented to efficiently solve a multi-objective HHC routing problem balancing the schedules of the nurses while maximizing quality of service (time windows, continuity, and consistency of care) and provider’s profit. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated using the ϵ-constraint method and small- and medium-size …
